# Photo Upload Guide

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 50MB per photo
- **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Recommended size**: 5-15MB for best performance

## Tips for Large Photos

### If your photo is larger than 50MB:

1. **Compress the image** using online tools:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - Free online compression
   - [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) - Good quality compression
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Google's compression tool

2. **Resize the image** to reduce file size:
   - Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 or smaller
   - Use your phone's camera settings to reduce resolution
   - Use photo editing software to resize

3. **Convert to JPEG** if it's a PNG or other format:
   - JPEG typically provides better compression
   - Maintains good quality for photos

### Best Practices:

1. **Use your phone's "High Quality" setting** instead of "Original Quality"
2. **Avoid uploading RAW files** - convert to JPEG first
3. **Test with a smaller version** before uploading the full-size photo
4. **Consider the purpose** - for modeling portfolios, high quality is important but doesn't need to be massive

### Troubleshooting:

- **"File too large" error**: Compress your image using one of the tools above
- **Upload fails**: Try a different browser or clear your browser cache
- **Slow upload**: Large files take time - be patient and don't refresh the page

### For Professional Photography:

If you're a professional photographer with very large files:
1. Create a web-optimized version (1920x1080, JPEG, 80% quality)
2. Keep the original for your own records
3. Upload the optimized version for the modeling application
